# League-Overlay

## Running the script

Run "Overlay.ahk" as admin.

## Using the script

The script is designed to work with the PoE-Trade Macro bindings, so the bindings are as follows:

F2 - Syndicate
F3 - Incursion
F4 - Atlas Progression
F6 - Fossil Locations

## Customizing the script

If you want to choose a different chart or adjust it for a different resolution, the recommended method is creating a new transparent image same size as your display resolution and sticking the chart guide in the desired position.
